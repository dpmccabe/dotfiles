# SendCode for Sublime Text

---
## SendCode v0.3

SendCode no longer defines keybinds for changing working directory. 
User should define their [own keybindings](#custom-keybindings) in the user settings.


---


Send code and text to macOS and Linux Terminals, iTerm, ConEmu, Cmder, Tmux, TerminalView; R (RStudio), Julia, IPython.

Following Programs are supported

- Mac: Terminal, iTerm (>=2.9), R GUI, RStudio Desktop, RStudio and Jupyter running on Chrome and Safari
- Windows: Cmder, ConEmu, R GUI, RStudio Desktop
- Linux: Tmux, Screen, Gnome-Terminal, Pantheon-Terminal, Mate-Terminal, Konsole, RStudio Desktop
- Others: TerminalView (requires [v0.5.0](https://github.com/Wramberg/TerminalView/tree/0.5.0) or above), SublimeREPL (deprecating)

### Installation

You could install SendCode via Package Control. If you are using Linux, the respective platform dependency
[xdotool](https://github.com/randy3k/sublime-xdotool) will also be installed automatically.


### Usage

Select a program using the command `SendCode: Choose Program` in command palette. The default program on macOS, windows and linux are Terminal, Cmder and tmux respectively. Each syntax binds to its own program. For instance, you could bind `R` to r files and `tmux` to python files.

There are two main keybindings:

- <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux)

    If text is selected, it sends the text to the program selected. If no text is selected, then it sends the current block (if found). Finally, it moves the cursor to the next line.


- <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (Windows/Linux): source current file (R, Julia and Python (IPython) only)

    SendCode uses Sublime build system to source files, you might have to choose the `Source File` option in a pop up window.


### Troubleshooting


1. Python console

   [IPython](https://ipython.org) (5.0 or above, or any repls which support bracketed paste mode) are assumed to be used. IPython 4.0 is still supported, but users need to disable `bracketed_paste_mode` in the settings.

1. RStudio on Windows

   If the code is pasted on the console but it is not being executed, you need to open an empty RScript file from the menu `File -> New File -> R Script`. This is a quick fix to a RStudio [issue](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/208160308-ctrl-enter-doesn-t-work-in-R-console-without-a-source-file-opened0) on Windows.

1. R Gui on Windows
   
   Make sure the corresponding R program is opened when you are sending the text.

1. Cmder/ Conemu on Windows

   You might need to set the path to `ConEmuC.exe` in SendCode settings. For Cmder, the file is located at 
   `<path to cmder folder>\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\ConEmuC.exe`.


1. Safari-Jupyter on macOS
   
   Most likely you haven't enabled JavaScript for AppleScript. Check the option "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" in the `Develop` menu (the `Develope` menu needs to be enabled in the preferences).


### Custom Keybindings

It is fairly easy to create your own keybinds for commands which you frequently use. For example, the following keybinds execute changing working directory commands for R, Python and Julia.

```json
[
    {
        "keys": ["ctrl+shift+h"], "command": "send_code",
        "args": {"cmd": "setwd(\"${file_path:$folder}\")"},
        "context": [
            { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.r" }
        ]
    },
    {
        "keys": ["ctrl+shift+h"], "command": "send_code",
        "args": {"cmd": "%cd \"${file_path:$folder}\""},
        "context": [
            { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.python" }
        ]
    },
    {
        "keys": ["ctrl+shift+h"], "command": "send_code",
        "args": {"cmd": "cd(\"${file_path:$folder}\")"},
        "context": [
            { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.julia" }
        ]
    }
]
```

SendCode expands following variables in the `cmd` field:

- `$file`, the full path to the file
- `$file_path`, the directory contains the file
- `$file_name`, the file name
- `$file_basename`, the file name without extension
- `$file_extension`, the file extension
- `$folder`, the first folder of current window
- `$project_path`, the directory where sublime-project is stored
- `$selection`, the text selected, or the word under cursor
- `$line`, the current line number

It also supports placeholders for variables, details can be found in the [unofficial documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems/configuration.html#placeholders-for-variables).

```
${file_path:$folder}
```
This will emit the directory of current file if there is one, otherwise the first folder of the current window.

You also don't have to worry about escaping quotes and backslashes between quotes, SendCode will
handle them for you.

The `prog` argument determines which program to use

```json
[
    {
        "keys": ["ctrl+shift+enter"], "command": "send_code",
        "args": {"cmd": "\n", "prog": "tmux"}
    }
]
```

### User settings

A couple of settings can be found `Preferences: SendCode Settings`

### Block expansion

SendCode uses the following logic to expand cursor when sending text.

- R blocks are detected by `{`,`}` pairs or knitr-spin `#+` decorators.
- Julia blocks are detected by `begin`, `end` pairs and indentations.
- Python blocks are detected by indentations or by `# %%`/`# In[]` decorators.
- Markdown fenced code blocks of [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box) are also supported.
